# themesh-dns (work in progress)
A standalone dns proxy server and library

# about
themes-dns is a fast and stable dns proxy, able to filter and dynamically modify incoming and outgoing messages with
custom filters on different levels. With the support for custom resolvers and an easy to use api, the project is a
great base for a home network filtering and routing system.

# status
Currently some basic features are implemented. The project is still missing
the filter structures and documentation
